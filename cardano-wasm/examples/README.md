# Examples

This folder contains three examples:

- A basic stand-alone example that makes a simple hard-coded transaction ([basic](./basic)).

- An example of using the grpc endpoint through `cardano-wasm` ([grpc](./grpc)).

- A simple wallet app that uses GRPC and allow creation of simple transactions interactively ([wallet](./simple-wallet))

In order to run the examples make sure you have built the main library as shown in the `cardano-wasm` readme in [the parent folder](..).
